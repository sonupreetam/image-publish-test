      Quality focuses on the processes and
      practices used to ensure the quality and
      reliability of the project's source code and
      software assets. These controls help ensure
      that the project's source code is well
      maintained, secure, and reliable, reducing the
      risk of defects or vulnerabilities in the
      software.

              When a commit is made to the primary branch, the project's version
              control system MUST require at least one non-author approval of the
              changes before merging.
            applicability:
              - Maturity Level 3
            recommendation: |
              Configure the project's version control system to require at least one
              non-author approval of changes before merging into the release or
              primary branch. This can be achieved by requiring a pull request to be
              reviewed and approved by at least one other contributor before it can
              be merged.
